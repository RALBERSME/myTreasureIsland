          You have now climbed the ladder of lower vibrational emotions. Perhaps
          you have simply clicked through the websites without doing the
          exercises. <br />
          The previous websites have dealt with emotions that we tend not to
          want to feel. But they are part of our lives. <br />
          We strive for higher vibrational emotions, such as happiness and love.
          <br />
          And yet we very rarely meet people in our lives who have overcome
          lower vibrational emotions and are truly living fulfilled and happy
          lives. And what about you? The probability is high that you too find
          yourself in the low vibrational area, in which the majority of people
          remain.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
          Even though I have designed the previous websites according to the
          motto K.I.S.S. (keep it short and simple), there are countless aspects
          that I have not yet addressed. I would therefore like to go into some
          of them in more detail on this page.<br /><br />

        <h3>
          Let's take this case from everyday life. You are on your way to a
          birthday party for which you have spent hours baking a cake. Now you
          just have to cross the street with the cake in your hand when a
          bicycle courier hits you without braking on the zebra crossing. You
          fall over and the cake flies in a high arc onto the street so that the
          next car drives over it. <br /><br />
          <u>Shame:</u> "Oh dear. This is going to be embarrassing at the party.
          Everyone has been waiting for the cake and I'm not even able to look
          after it on the street and bring it to the party in one piece. I'm so
          embarrassed. I'm no good either." <br /><br />
          <u>Guilt:</u>"It was obvious that this would happen to me. How
          incapable I am. I can't even carry a cake across the street. I really
          should have looked to the left again. I just walk through life too
          dreamily." <br /><br /><u>Apathy:</u>"Whatever, that sort of thing
          happens all the time. They probably wouldn't have liked my cake
          anyway. They won't miss the cake or me. I should just stop going to
          the party. Life is really shit."<br /><br /><u>Sadness</u>"Oh my
          goodness. The cake is just mush. What will the birthday boy think?
          I'll massively disappoint him and then our friendship won't be as
          harmonious as it was before. I could cry."<br /><br /><u>Fear</u>"The
          front wheel of the bike is completely dented. Now he's sure to freak
          out because he needs the bike to earn money. It's better if I don't
          say anything, don't complain and just keep walking. It's best if I
          don't ask him to replace the cake either. The guy is much younger and
          bigger than me. He'll yell at me or give me another Slap him in the
          face." <br /><br /><u>Demand:</u>"Just wait, you kid, you're going to
          pay me dearly for that. First I'm going to demand a master cake from
          the bakery around the corner, then he should buy me a new outfit,
          because I've been lying in the dirt because of him. And after the
          party I'll ask my lawyer what else we can get out of it."<br /><br /><u
            >Anger:</u
          >"He's lost his mind! Can't the idiot pay attention? I'll kick him in
          his damn bike. He'll be lucky if I don't kill him. Guys like that
          should be banned from riding bikes. "<br /><br /><u>Pride:</u>"Hey,
          you idiot, look where you're going. That's probably why you have to
          deliver pizza, because otherwise you can't get anything done. You're
          probably such a big loser that you don't even have insurance. Bad
          luck, then it's going to be really expensive for you. I, on the other
          hand, am insured with the most expensive and best insurance company,
          and they'll give you a hard time."<br /><br /><u>Courage:</u>"Well, it
          was a bad turn. But we're both insured. The insurance companies will
          sort it out. I'll make sure that we settle it out of court and in such
          a way that you don't get into big trouble with your boss."<br /><br /><u
            >Neutrality: </u
          >"Well, that's life. It can happen to anyone."<br /><br /><u
            >Willingness:</u
          >"My God, the bike courier is beside himself. He is worried about his
          job. What can I do to calm him down? I tell him that our insurance
          will sort it out and then we will be fine."<br /><br /><u
            >Acceptance:</u
          >"Phew, we were lucky. It could have been worse. Basically, only the
          cake is ruined, I am a bit dusty and his front wheel is dented. All of
          that can be replaced for little money. Basically, nothing serious has
          happened."<br /><br /><u>Reason:</u>"How can we get this thing off the
          ice as quickly as possible? I'll google it. Look, there is a bike
          repair shop just around the corner. You can have the front wheel
          replaced there. I quickly shake the dust off myself and get a frozen
          cake from the supermarket. Then the party can still go on."<br /><br /><u
            >Love:</u
          >"I hope nothing has happened to you other than the bike. Calm down,
          we'll let our insurance take care of it all. It's really not a big
          deal. I've also caused an accident on my bike before and I can
          understand how you feel now. Don't worry. (puts arm on shoulder)"<br />

        </h2>
        <h3>
          <br /><br />
          There are primary and secondary feelings. Primary feelings are those
          that underlie our actions. Our primary feelings are not always
          immediately apparent to ourselves or others, as they can be covered up
          by secondary feelings.<br />
          <br /><em
            >The following example should illustrate this: <br /><br />Till is
            violently bumped into by someone. The primary feeling is anger.
            Till's impulse would be to complain. But he has learned that anger
            is dangerous because then the other person could also become angry
            and threaten him (fear). The other person could make a loud scene so
            that passers-by would notice (shame), and perhaps Till himself was
            not paying attention in the end (guilt). All of these secondary
            emotions regulate Till's original anger, so that in the end he just
            lets the matter rest with the friendly words "everything's OK,
            nothing happened". Later, Till gets angry with himself and
            criticizes himself for not defending himself, for being anxious and
            lacking self-confidence, and he sadly withdraws.</em
          ><br /><br />Primary emotions are natural and serve a purpose. They
          last until the situation is over. Secondary emotions, on the other
          hand, are constructed; they serve to regulate relationships and our
          inner life and can last much longer. Therefore, it is important to
          work out whether the emotion we are currently feeling is a primary or
          a secondary one.<br /><br /><a

          <u>Stress:</u>
        </h2>
        <h3>
          <br /><br />
          Stress is on everyone's lips these days. Stress is understood as the
          natural reaction of the body and soul to external or internal stresses
          and challenges. This applies to both difficult situations, but also to
          situations that we see as positive, such as bungee jumping or a
          corporate career.
          <br /><br />
          The stress triggers cause the body to release more hormones such as
          adrenaline and cortisol. This increases our reaction ability. The
          purpose of these physical reactions is to ensure survival in dangerous
          situations by enabling us to perform at our best. Stress therefore has
          a motivating and activating effect, so that we can better master
          challenges.
          <br /><br />
          If the stress load is too high or constant, there is a risk that the
          positive effect will turn negative. Constant tension and excessive
          demands can make you mentally and physically ill. This also applies to
          too much positive stress.<br /><br />
          The greatest stress is not caused by external stimuli (noise,
          environment) but by the pressure of our own suppressed emotions. This
          is precisely why it is important to deal with your feelings in more
          depth. <br /><br />The human alarm system is structured as follows.
          First, the alarm reaction comes from the cerebral cortex. From there
          it reaches deeper layers of the brain such as the hypthalamus, then
          into the adrenal glands and the bloodstream (cortisol and adrenaline).
          Brain hormones are also released and the sympathetic nervous system is
          stimulated. The body is now flooded with adrenaline and prepares for
          fight or flight. The person thus finds himself in a struggle for
          survival. <br /><br />You may have noticed that your body goes crazy
          at times when you want to relax. You go on holiday stressed and then
          get sick or depressed. This is partly because your body has become
          accustomed to high cortisol levels and is addicted to maintaining
          them.<br /><br />In the resistance phase, the phase that follows the
          alarm reaction, the body tries to restore a homeostatic balance. This
          is where hormonal changes and shifts in metabolism occur. This can
          lead to water retention in the body (e.g. in the legs and feet).
          <br /><br />This is followed by the exhaustion phase. This is
          adrenaline exhaustion, which causes the immune system to become weak.
          It can no longer compensate for the effects of stress. The suppression
          of the immune system and the depletion of energy reserves lead to
          illness and, in extreme cases, death. <br /><br />Permanent stress
          also affects the digestive system. This leads to hyperacidity and an
          overproduction of digestive enzymes can lead to the formation of
          ulcers. The cardiovascular system in particular suffers. Stress is one
          of the main causes of high blood pressure, heart attacks and heart
          attacks. <br /><br />Nowadays, a connection between stress and cancer
          is also suspected. <br /><a

            Davies</a

        <h3>
          When we get angry, it is a reaction to a rule that we have
          internalized being broken. Often we are not even aware of this rule.
          These rules often come from our childhood, when we adopted certain
          ideas about how something should or should not be through education or
          imitation of our environment. The internalization of these rules
          therefore took place at a time when we were not yet adults and
          therefore usually without questioning the beliefs we had adopted. Such
          beliefs can be, for example, that as a boy you are not allowed to cry
          or that it is not fair if you are not allowed to play, that friends
          always have to stick by you, etc.<br /><br />When we are angry, we
          want to use all means possible to ensure that "our" rules are
          followed. To this end, we may manipulate, force others to do
          something, shout, threaten, use our authority, use violence
          (psychological or physical, against things or people) and much more.
          This can cause the situation to escalate even further.<br /><br />It
          is therefore important to recognize that the core message of anger is
          our belief that <u>something has to change.</u> One of our rules has
          been broken and we are therefore pushing for this breach to be
          healed.<br /><br />It is very important to first recognize which rule
          is behind our anger, which we see as broken. The next step is to
          accept that this is <u>our</u> rule, which the other person does not
          even have to know. The question also arises as to whether our rule is
          correct at all. It is also important to question whether our rule is
          correct.<br /><br />The following attitudes are less helpful: negative
          assessments, condemnations, inability to forgive.<br /><br />Instead,
          the interest of wanting to understand one another should come to the
          fore. What works best is to ask simple, open questions to find out why
          the other person behaves the way they do.<br /><br />
          It is crucial that we recognize that our anger is never wrong in
          itself. It only indicates that we have been triggered by something and
          that an expectation/rule of ours has been violated. We also tend to
          believe what others tell us when we are angry. "You are acting like a
          child. You are an idiot." This can make us even angrier. This
          realization is also important if someone else gets angry because of
          our behavior. So it would be appropriate to convey to the other person
          that it is not they as a person who is stupid or childish, but only
          their behavior. Since words can cause more damage in the long run than
          physical violence, we should choose them carefully. <br /><br />
          Instead of harming others, anger should be used productively.<br /><br />Don't
          treat others in a way you don't want them to treat you. It's best to
          pause for a moment to calm down before you say anything. In some
          situations, it may be appropriate to leave the place for a while to
          create a break. Then think about what your long-term priorities are.
          Do you want to be right in this argument, or is the relationship more
          important to you? <br />How can the resulting communication gap be
          bridged? Now it's time to learn to understand the other person's
          position, if necessary, to define what everyone has understood and
          how, and to convey how you want to be understood yourself. It is also
          helpful to capture the emotions in pictures.<br /><br />Ultimately,
          the decisive factor is that we let the anger go, because it blocks our
          strength, our freedom and our development. The anger does not come
          from the other person, it is in us and therefore our issue. But if we
          do not let it go, we will be the ones who continue to suffer from it.
          <br /><br />
          <u>Ways to let go:</u> <br /><br />Mentally go back through your life;
          does this anger sound familiar to you? When did it first occur to you?
          What was the situation like back then? What triggered this emotion?<br /><br />
          What was wrong back then? What did you subjectively perceive as wrong
          back then?<br /><br />What bad insight can you learn from it? What
          good insight can you learn from it?<br /><br />Talk in your mind to
          the perpetrator who treated you wrongly and leave the responsibility
          for it with him.<br /><br />Now say goodbye to this old situation
          forever and take the good insights/learning effects that you gained
          from it with you into your life today.<br /><br />Apologize to the
          person you got angry at today. Show the person that you value them and
          that your relationship with them is important to you. Express your
          regret and ask for forgiveness.<br /><br />If your rule that was
          broken was not good, change your rule. Ask yourself whether the rule
          really corresponds to how you think about yourself and the world
          today.<br /><br />
          Future pace: Imagine yourself in a situation in the future in which
          you are already applying the new, revised rule. What will it be like?
          How will you feel then?<br /><br />
          <u>Conclusion: Anger feeds anger.</u><br /><br />
          Even purely factual arguments can lead to the escalation continuing.
          Therefore, perceive the emotion and respond to the emotion. If that is
          not possible at the moment, take a break. Intense emotions, such as
          anger, are an expression of a lack of empathy. Empathy is the ability
          to understand how the other person feels and why they feel the way
          they do. Try to see the situation from their perspective.
          <br /><br />Recognize that the conflict is not just about you, but
          about everyone. <br /><br /><u>How to deal with angry people:</u>
          <br /><br />If someone gets angry, then one of their rules has been
          broken. If they are constantly angry, then they constantly have the
          feeling that their rules are being broken. These rules can be
          reasonable or unreasonable and they can come from a time when they had
          a completely different meaning. <br /><br />Be part of the solution to
          the problem, not the reinforcement of the problem. <br /><br />Show
          empathy, because empathy means understanding. Empathy does not mean
          that you agree with everything or accept the other person's rule or
          behavior.<br /><br />
